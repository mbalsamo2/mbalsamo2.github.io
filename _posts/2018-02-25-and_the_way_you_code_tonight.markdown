Some day, when I'm awfully low
When the world needs code
I will feel a glow just thinking of you
And the way you code tonight


Sinatra App project is completed and I must say I am starting to feel like a programmer. Even though I know I have only started to open the Pandora's Box that is coding, I am absolutely loving how far I have come. 

I remember the feeling of pride after finishing my CLI Gem Project, and that feeling has only intensified after the completion of my Sinatra App.

Even though there was a lot that went into this project, between the models, the controllers, and the views, the labs leading up this project helped me feel very confident as I began working.

I decided to build on the "Foodie" theme that I used in my CLI Gem Project by creating a Foodie Cookbook App that allows users to create recipes to build an online recipe cookbook. 

I am already surprised to see how much "magic" can come from using ActiveRecord and Sinatra, I can't even imagine what type of magic the next sections include. 

As soon as I was done with this project, I sent the video demo to my family and they are all so amazed that I created something that was interative with users. It was tough to decide to switch careers, but I'm really starting to believe just how good of a decision it was to switch to programming because of how excited I am to share my work with other people.

I love how each project just energizes me even more to move into the next section and learn what else programming has in store for me.
